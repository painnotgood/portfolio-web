                Led a seven-person team to develop ML-powered house price predictor for District 10, HCMC based on three most important factors: location, size, number of bedrooms. <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Orchestrated full development pipeline with weekly reports: data scraping, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, website deploying through Flask. <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Reduced noise by downsampling by 60% (12k â†’ 5k samples) and erased outliers by removing the third standard deviation of the filtered dataset. <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Applied XGBoost and Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, increasing the accuracy by 50% on the second test set run. <br></br>

                Experimented 3 different classification architectures on the CIFAR-10 dataset with no pretrained models under the time constraints of 4 hours for implementing, tuning, and training.<br></br>
                <br></br>
                Generated over 100 hyperparameter combinations while narrowing down the range gradually on a uniform distribution to find the best hyperparameters. Applied advanced data augmentation strategies for images and model ensemble on 10 different random restart points.<br></br>
                <br></br>
                Results: 95% accuracy on the test set.

                Led a team of 6 members to design, build, and program an autonomous robot using Arduino for a Physics-Informatics Interdepartmental Thematic Report to Department of Education of Ho Chi Minh City and various schools in the area. <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Built a robot capable of doing a series of 5 tasks - activating the renewable electricity factory, planting trees, destroying polluting factories, sorting waste, and measuring the pollution levels in the area - on a simulation map. <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Result: Won the Third Prize.
